A System... A system is a combination of software (and sometimes hardware) that provides a solution for a problem. A System involves: - The client( Request and $) - Analysts - Designers & developers -Testers - Users -Others (Lawyers, Communications Officers, Specialists etc)
Measuring Success... Success may be measured by answering the following questions: - Does the project solve what it was meant to solve? Is it scalable to meet the needs of the client? Was it delivered on time and ready to go? Was the client happy with the product?
The Software Development Process... Computer scientists have created a view of the software development process known as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Waterfall Model... A mistake in one phase often requires the developer to backup and redo some of the work in the previous phase. There are several phases: -Problem Statement -Analysis -Design -Implementation -Integration/Test -Maintenance
The Software Development Process... Mistakes found early in the SDLC are much less expensive to correct than those found later. The cost of developing software is not spread equally over phases
The Gantt Chart... Developed by mechanical engineer Henry Gantt in the 1910s. -Tool typically used by people working on a large project, like Hoover Dam or Eisenhower National Defense Interstate Highway System -Helps project managers to visualize, schedule, and track schedules as well as actual progress of projects
UML... "Unified Modeling Language" -Visually specifies parts of a system -Complex software designs are much more easily described through UML than textually
