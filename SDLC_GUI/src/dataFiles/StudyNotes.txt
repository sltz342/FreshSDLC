A System... A system is a combination of software (and sometimes hardware) that provides a solution for a problem.
A System involves: The client( Request and $), Analysts, Designers & developers, Testers, Users
The Software Development Process... also known as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Waterfall Model... A mistake in one phase often requires the developer to backup & redo work in the previous phase. 
There are several phases of the SDLC: Problem Statement, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Test, Fixes
The Software Development Process... Mistakes found early in the SDLC are less expensive to correct than later. 
The cost of developing software is not spread equally over phases
The Gantt Chart... Developed by mechanical engineer Henry Gantt in the 1910s. 
The SDLC is a tool typically used by people working on a large project, helps project managers visualize & track progress of projects
UML... "Unified Modeling Language" is complex software designs are much more easily described through UML than textually
